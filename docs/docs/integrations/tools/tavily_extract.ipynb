Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d\\'Or awards and four the Best FIFA Men\\'s Player awards.[note 2] He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies,[note 3] including twelve league titles, four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa Américas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most European Golden Shoes (6), most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals for a single club (672, with Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most assists (18) and goal contributions (32) in the Copa América, most goal contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international appearances (191) and international goals (112) by a South American male, and the second-most in the latter category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals and has provided over 380 assists for club and country.[16]\\nBorn in Rosario, Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, and made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He gradually established himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the first of four consecutive Ballons d\\'Or, and by the 2011–12 season he would set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season and establish himself as Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. However, he regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, led Barcelona to a historic second treble, and won a fifth Ballon d\\'Or in 2015. He assumed Barcelona\\'s captaincy in 2018 and won a record sixth Ballon d\\'Or in 2019. During his overall tenure at Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, among others. Financial difficulties at Barcelona led to Messi signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he would win the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. He joined Major League Soccer club Inter Miami in July 2023.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the national team\\'s all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew career-long comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. At the youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a World Cup in 2006. Assuming captaincy in 2011, he then led Argentina to three consecutive finals in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which they would exit early. Messi and the national team finally broke Argentina\\'s 28-year trophy drought by winning the 2021 Copa América, which helped him secure his seventh Ballon d\\'Or that year. He then led Argentina to win the 2022 Finalissima, as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his country\\'s third overall world championship and first in 36 years. This followed with a record-extending eighth Ballon d\\'Or in 2023, and a victory in the 2024 Copa América.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1\\xa0billion in career earnings. Following his arrival and impact on football in the US, Messi was named Time\\'s Athlete of the Year in 2023, and in the following year was bestowed with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by decision of the president of the United States.\\nEarly life\\n\\nMessi\\'s childhood home in Rosario, Santa Fe.\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe Province,[17] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father\\'s side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother\\'s side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \"Leo\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[18] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[19] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[20][21]\\nYouth career\\nNewell\\'s Old Boys\\n\\n\"When you saw him you would think: this kid can\\'t play ball. He\\'s a dwarf, he\\'s too fragile, too small. But immediately you\\'d realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.\"\\n\\n– Newell\\'s Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[22]\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was seven years old. During the six years he played for Newell\\'s, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of \\'87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team\\'s home games.[23][24][25] His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I\\'ve ever seen\".[26]\\nHowever, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father\\'s health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell\\'s agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[27] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised.[28][29] It was speculated that he failed to sign with River Plate due to his ill health; however, in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that River Plate had offered to pay for his medical treatment after he scored four goals at a trial. River wanted to sign him, but Newell\\'s Old Boys, who had refused to pay for his treatment, also refused to release his player card, preventing the transfer.[30]\\nBarcelona\\n\\nMessi enrolled at Barcelona\\'s youth academy, La Masia, aged 13.\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First-team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[28][31] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club\\'s stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell\\'s; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[23][31][32]\\nAfter a year at Barcelona\\'s youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[33] After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14,[34] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona\\'s greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[33][35] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[36] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[31][37][38]\\nMessi continued to progress through the club\\'s ranks at a rapid pace, debuting for four youth teams during the 2003–04 season.[39] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juvenil B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juvenil A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[40][41] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard\\'s first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team\\'s starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"[42]\\n\\n\"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.\"\\n\\n– Barcelona\\'s then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi\\'s first-team debut.[43]\\nAt 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho\\'s Porto on 16 November 2003.[31][44] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club\\'s reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[45] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça\\'s new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[46] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called \"little brother\", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[47][48]\\nTo gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juvenil A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla\\'s Sergio Ramos.[40][49] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30\\xa0million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80\\xa0million.[40][50] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[51] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juvenil B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[40][49]\\nClub career\\nMain article: Career of Lionel Messi § Club career\\nBarcelona\\n2004–2008: Rise to the first team\\n\\nMessi (pictured in 2005) at the age of 18 playing for FC Barcelona, where he played for 17 years.\\nMessi began the 2004–05 season as a guaranteed starter for the Barcelona B team, but after some lobbying by the senior players, he was promoted to the first team by manager Frank Rijkaard.[46] He made his La Liga debut for Barcelona on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol,[31] and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[52][53] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition, and the club won the league title during that season.[48][54]\\nOn his 18th birthday, he signed his first contract as a senior team player, which was updated three months later to keep him at the club until 2014.[50][55] Barcelona began the 2005–06 season by winning the Supercopa de España without Messi, who was not selected to participate in the competition.[14] By the end of the season, the team won La Liga again as well as the UEFA Champions League, although Messi did not play in the final for the latter due to injury.[56][57]\\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico against Real Madrid, the first player to do so in 12 years.[58] An incredibly finesse goal from Messi against Getafe and another goal scored by a handball against Espanyol gained notice for their similarities to the two famous goals scored by fellow Argentine Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup match against England, drawing comparisons between the two that Messi would face throughout his career.[59][60][61] The team finished the season with only one trophy – the 2006 Supercopa de España. Barcelona finished the next 2007–08 season trophyless, leading to Rijkaard\\'s departure.[62]\\n2008–2012: Success under Pep Guardiola\\nAt the beginning of the 2008–09 season, his first under Barcelona\\'s new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[63] Over time, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola\\'s possession-based system, increasing his goalscoring rate as a result.[64] During that season, Messi scored 38 total goals, and alongside Samuel Eto\\'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[65][66] Messi played as a false nine for the first time in a Clásico against Real Madrid, setting up his side\\'s first goal and scoring twice in the team\\'s greatest-ever score at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[67][68] He played his first final, winning the Copa del Rey.[69] In addition, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, thus achieving the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[70]\\n\\nMessi during the 2009 Joan Gamper Trophy against Manchester City.\\nDuring the first half of the 2009–10 season, Barcelona would also win the Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, resulting in becoming the first club to achieve the sextuple.[71][72] Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament\\'s history.[73] For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[74] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo\\'s club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[75][76] He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League,[77] and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[76][78]\\nIn the 2010–11 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de España,[79] Champions League,[80] and a third consecutive La Liga title. His club performances in 2010 earned him his second consecutive Ballon d\\'Or.[81] Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year,[82] and the league\\'s top scorer and assist provider.[83][84] He became Barcelona\\'s all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.[83][85]\\n\\n\"I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi\\'s throne – it\\'s impossible, this kid is unique.\"\\n\\n– Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer at the age of 24 in March 2012[86]\\nMessi began the 2011–12 season winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies.[87][88] At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time.[89] For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or three times,[90] and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award.[91] During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns.[92][93] Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[94] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football excluding regional and local competitions.[95][96] The team would also win the Copa del Rey that season, their 14th trophy under Guardiola, who resigned following the season after a four-year cycle of success.[97]\\n2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia\\n\\nMessi scored a record-breaking 91 goals with Argentina (above) and Barcelona (below) in 2012.\\nFor the start of the 2012–13 season, Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013.[98] A double scored against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd Müller\\'s record of most goals scored in a calendar year; Messi would score a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina throughout 2012.[99][100] Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming the first player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or four times.[100][101] He signed a new contract committing himself to the club through 2018, and wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time in a league match against Rayo Vallecano.[102][103][104] The team would win La Liga again that year, Messi\\'s sixth, equalling Real Madrid\\'s 100-point record of the previous season. With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[105]\\nMessi\\'s overall input into the team\\'s attack had increased significantly. Whereas he contributed to 24% of the team\\'s goals in their treble-winning campaign, this number rose to more than 40% by the end of the 2012–13 season.[106] These statistics, as well as lopsided losses in the Champions League where Messi was unfit, gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona\\'s perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[107]\\nTo offset the load on Messi, Barcelona would sign Brazilian forward Neymar from Santos before the 2013–14 season.[108] The team would win the Supercopa de España at the beginning of the season.[109] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[110] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy.[111]\\n2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN\\n\\nMessi dribbling past Patrice Evra of Juventus during the 2015 UEFA Champions League final.\\nBarcelona hired coach Luis Enrique before the 2014–15 season, and would continue to aid Messi in the attack by signing Uruguayan forward Luis Suárez, who had won the European Golden Shoe the year before at Liverpool.[112][113] Luis Enrique\\'s system would feature quick transitions from defense to attack, led by the front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar. The attacking trio, which colloquially became known as \\'MSN\\', would break goalscoring records.[114] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla earlier in the season would also make him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[115] After securing the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League that year, Messi helped Barcelona become the first club to win the continental treble twice.[116][117] He would record 58 goals, but combined with Neymar and Suárez, the attacking trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[118]\\nMessi opened the 2015–16 season by helping Barcelona\\'s win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[119] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final over River Plate in Yokohama, collecting his fifth club trophy of the calendar year.[120] On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[121] He would end the season by winning La Liga as well as the Copa del Rey again.[122] In total, Messi scored 41 goals, and Barcelona\\'s attacking trio of him, Neymar and Suárez managed a Spanish record of 131 combined goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[123]\\nThe 2016–17 season would end with Messi winning the Supercopa de España and the Copa del Rey.[124][125] He would finish the season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[126] Messi, Neymar and Suárez would combine for 110 goals by season\\'s end. Neymar would depart for Paris Saint Germain the next year, leaving the attacking trio with a combined total of 363 goals over the course of three seasons.[127] Luis Enrique would also leave Barcelona at the end of the season after managing the club to a total of nine trophies during his three-year tenure.[128]\\n2017–2021: Final years at Barcelona\\n\\nMessi, wearing the captain\\'s armband, against Real Valladolid in 2018.\\nMessi would sign a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November 2017, keeping him with the club through 2021.[129] The 2017–18 season saw Messi achieving the domestic double, winning La Liga and the Copa del Rey once again.[130] He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga, with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth European Golden Shoe award.[131] With the departure of former captain Andrés Iniesta in May 2018, Messi was named the team\\'s new captain for the 2018–19 season.[132] He lifted his first trophy as Barcelona\\'s captain, the Supercopa de España, following a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. He helped Barcelona clinch the La Liga title, his tenth but first as captain.[133] With 36 goals in 34 appearances that season, he won his sixth league Golden Boot trophy, equalling Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga.[134][135] He also captured his sixth Golden Shoe award, and a record third consecutive award since the 2016–17 season.[136]\\nMessi would win his sixth Ballon d\\'Or, but the subsequent 2019–20 season saw Barcelona go trophyless for the first time since 2007–08.[137] Following a disappointing season, Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club \"a document expressing his desire to leave\", but Messi ultimately decided to fulfill the final year of his contract.[138][139] The 2020–21 season saw Messi surpass Xavi\\'s record to reach a club record of 768 appearances.[140] He would lead the club to victory in the 2021 Copa del Rey final.[141][142] His last two seasons with Barcelona saw him lead La Liga in goal scoring, giving him a record-breaking total of eight Pichichi trophies.[143][144]\\nMessi became a free agent after his contract expired, with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to Barcelona\\'s financial issues.[145][146] Barcelona would eventually announce that Messi would not be staying at the club, citing financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi\\'s departure.[147][148] In a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[149]\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n\\nMessi (middle) with PSG team-mates Kylian Mbappé (left) and Neymar.\\nOn 10 August 2021, Messi joined Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), reuniting him with Neymar, for the 2021–22 season on a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[150][151] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[152] He would make his debut with the club against Reims, made his first start and Champions League debut for the club against Club Brugge, and made his home debut in a match against Lyon[153][154][155] He scored his first goal for the club in a Champions League group stage win over former manager Pep Guardiola\\'s Manchester City.[156] Having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year in addition to captaining Argentina to the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d\\'Or.[157] He finished his debut season with PSG with 11 goals and 14 assists across all competitions, helping the club win their 10th Ligue 1 title.[158]\\nBeginning the 2022–23 season, Messi would win his second trophy with PSG in the Trophée des Champions.[159] A goal against Nice resulted in him surpassing Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time highest goalscorer in European club football with 702 goals; during the match, he also achieved 1,000 career direct goal contributions at club level.[160][161] By the end of the season, he had 21 goals across all competitors and the highest number of assists in the league with 16, which helped PSG clinch their 11th Ligue 1 title and his second in a row.[162][163][164] Following the last game of the season, manager Christophe Galtier confirmed that it would be Messi\\'s last for PSG, with the club confirming his departure two days later.[165]\\nInter Miami\\n\\nMessi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup.\\nMajor League Soccer (MLS) club Inter Miami CF announced the signing of Messi on a two-and-a-half-year contract on 15 July 2023.[166][167] Messi made his 2023 debut for the club in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a victory.[168] Messi\\'s arrival in the US was praised a revelation, on and off the pitch, with his presence being credited for helping to raise the profile of MLS. According to Goal, \"Every game that he graces sparks a scramble for tickets, with plenty of A-list guests eager to watch him in action\".[169] The frenzy over his arrival was dubbed “Messimania”; Inter Miami\\'s No. 10 Messi jersey became the best-selling jersey in the league—and nearly the world.[170]\\nAfter scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi led the team to the club\\'s first-ever trophy by winning the Leagues Cup against Nashville SC.[171] Messi made his MLS debut against the New York Red Bulls.[172] Miami would miss the playoffs, finish 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[173] On 30 October 2023, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d\\'Or.[174] He was also named Time Athlete of the Year, the first footballer to ever win the award.[175]\\nDuring the 2024 season, Messi broke the record for the most assists in a single MLS game with five assists and he also broke the record for the most goal contributions in an MLS game with six in a 6–2 win over the New York Red Bulls.[176] On 2 October, Messi scored a brace in a 3–2 win over Columbus Crew, clinching the Supporters\\' Shield, his 46th trophy.[177] In the final game of the regular season on 19 October against the New England Revolution, Messi scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 6–2 victory. Inter Miami\\'s victory over the Revolution also allowed the club to finish with 74 points throughout the regular season, a league record for MLS. He would finish the regular season with 20 goals and 16 assists in 19 matches.[178] In doing so, he became Inter Miami\\'s all-time leading goalscorer.[179]\\nMiami made its first postseason appearance in the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs but were eliminated in the first round after losing two games against Atlanta United FC. Messi would have his first postseason goal in the third game, a 3–2 loss.[180] He would be named the MLS Most Valuable Player following the conclusion of the regular season.[181]\\nInternational career\\nMain article: Career of Lionel Messi § International career\\nAs a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[182] He debuted for Argentina in 2004 for Argentina\\'s U20 team against Paraguay, and was subsequently included in the squad for the 2005 South American U-20 Championship, where they would finish third.[183] Messi would then lead the team to victory in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, his first success with Argentina. Finishing the tournament with six goals and two assists, he would also win the Golden Ball.[184][185][186]\\n\\nMessi evades Brazil\\'s Marcelo in the semi-final of the 2008 Summer Olympics.\\nMessi would make his debut with the senior national team in 2005, at age 18, coming off the bench in a friendly against Hungary.[187] Messi would have his first start in 2006 against Peru, and would score his first international goal in a friendly against Croatia.[188][189] His World Cup debut came in the 2006 FIFA World Cup as a substitute in the 74th minute against Serbia and Montenegro, assisting one goal and scoring the final one in their victory. This made him the youngest player to represent and score for Argentina in the World Cup.[190] He would represent Argentina again for the 2007 Copa América, where they would ultimately lose in the final. Messi was named the best young player of the tournament, having scored two goals and provided one assist.[191] The 2008 Summer Olympics would mark another major achievement with his country, as he led Argentina\\'s U23 team to claim the Olympic gold medal over Nigeria. Messi registered two goals and three assists throughout, and was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament\\'s best team.[192]\\n\\nMessi in his number 10 shirt captaining Argentina in 2012.\\nWith the international retirement of Juan Román Riquelme, Messi was given Argentina\\'s number 10 shirt.[193] During a 2010 FIFA World Cup group stage match against Greece, where a majority of the starters rested due to a secured place in the knockout rounds, Messi would wear the captain\\'s armband for the first time.[194] Argentina were ultimately eliminated in the quarterfinals against Germany during that tournament, but Messi was identified as one of the tournament\\'s 10 best players due to his pace and creativity, despite failing to register a single goal and only having one assist.[195] Ahead of the 2011 Copa América, Argentina began building their team around Messi.[196] However, Messi would again be goalless during the tournament but had three assists. The team would ultimately lose to Uruguay in penalties during the quarter-finals.[197]\\n\\nMessi against Germany in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.\\nFollowing their unsuccessful performance, a 24-year-old Messi would be awarded the captaincy of the squad.[198] The next several years saw many frustrations for Messi due to his inability to lead Argentina to win an international trophy. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Messi and Argentina lost to Germany in the final, though Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament regardless due to his overall performance with four goals and an assist.[199][200] Argentina would lose to Chile on penalties in the 2015 Copa América final the next year. At the close of the tournament, Messi was reportedly selected to receive the Golden Ball award, having scored one goal and provided three assists, but he rejected the honour.[201] In the 2016 Copa América Centenario semi-final against the United States, a goal from Messi would put him ahead of Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina\\'s all-time leading goalscorer in international matches.[202] However, Argentina would again fall to Chile on penalties in the final.[203] Messi would have five goals and four assists throughout the tournament.[204]\\nLosing three consecutive finals in three consecutive years caused Messi to retire from international football, but a nationwide campaign in Argentina helped convince him to reverse his decision.[203][205] He would return to the national team to lead them to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Argentina were in jeopardy of missing the tournament on the last game of the qualifiers against Ecuador, but a hat-trick from Messi dramatically secured their entry.[206] They would go on to lose to France in the Round of 16 during the World Cup, with Messi having one goal and two assists in the tournament.[207] The next year, Messi would again represent Argentina in the 2019 Copa América, where he registered only a single goal and assist. They would lose to hosts Brazil in the semi-final but ended with a third-place finish after defeating Chile.[208] This victory would mark the beginning of a 36-game unbeaten streak that would last for over three years.[209]\\n\\nMessi facing off against Érick Gutiérrez of Mexico in the 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage.\\nMessi would finally end Argentina\\'s 28-year trophy drought in the 2021 Copa América, as they had not won an international tournament since 1993.[210] During a group stage match against Bolivia, he surpassed Javier Mascherano to become Argentina\\'s most-capped player.[211] Argentina defeated Brazil in the final, and Messi was named the player of the tournament having been directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four of them and assisting five.[210] He captained Argentina to win another international trophy in the 2022 Finalissima against UEFA Euro 2020 winners Italy, where he was named player of the match after providing two assists.[212] At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Messi led Argentina to its first World Cup victory in 36 years, scoring twice in the final to defeat France.[213] Having scored seven goals and assisting three during the tournament, Messi would again win the Golden Ball, becoming the first player to win it twice.[214] His appearance in the final also set new records for the most appearances (26) and direct goal contributions (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists) at the World Cup.[215]\\nA hat-trick in a 2023 friendly against Curaçao saw Messi reach 100 international goals, the third player and the first South American in history to achieve this milestone.[216] Later that year, a goal against Peru resulted in Messi becoming the all-time top goalscorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers.[217] During the 2024 Copa América semi-final against Canada, Messi scored his first and only goal of the tournament which also made him the second-highest international goalscorer of all time.[218] Argentina eventually won the final against Colombia for their second consecutive Copa América title, with Messi contributing one goal and assist overall while also setting a new record for most appearances (39) at Copa América.[219]\\nPlayer profile\\nStyle of play\\n\\nMessi prepares to shoot with his dominant left foot in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[220][221] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (\"The Atomic Flea\").[222][223][224] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[23][221][225] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[226] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\"[227] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[228][229]\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[230] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[231][232][233] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[221][234] As of September 2023, Messi ranks fifth all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[235] the most among active players.[236] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[237]\\n\\nMessi\\'s dribbling abilities allow him to weave past several defenders and orchestrate attacking plays.\\nMessi\\'s pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[225][234][238] He is widely considered to be one of the greatest dribblers of all time.[239][240] With regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \"The ball stays glued to his foot; I\\'ve seen great players in my career, but I\\'ve never seen anyone with Messi\\'s ball control.\"[229] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[220][221]\\nAs his career advanced, and his athleticism and tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[241][242][243] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[244]\\nTactical positioning\\n\\nA versatile forward, Messi often plays as a classic number 10.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[245] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[227] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates\\' attacking runs off the ball, Messi\\'s own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[32]\\nUnder the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager\\'s 4–3–3 formation,[246][247] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[248][249] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[250] or even on the right wing[251] or as a false nine,[252][253] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[249] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team\\'s attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Luis Suárez.[254][255] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline. Under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[256][257]\\nReception\\nMessi is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo.[258] He is also considered one of the greatest footballers in the history of the sport.[259]\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world\\'s best players before age 20.[260] Shortly after teammate Ronaldinho won the 2005 Ballon d\\'Or, he commented, \"I\\'m not even the best at Barça\" in reference to his 18-year-old protégé.[261] Four years later, after Messi won his first Ballon d\\'Or by a record margin,[74] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[19][225][262] An early proponent was his then-Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[263] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players.[85][264] By the end of Barça\\'s second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[265][266]\\nMessi would receive dismissals by critics throughout his career based on the fact that he had not won an international tournament at senior level with Argentina.[267][268][269] However, his subsequent victories in the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup resulted in him finally winning every top tier trophy at both the club and country levels, an achievement that many pundits felt cemented Messi\\'s legacy.[259]\\nComparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\\nMain article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry\\n\\nMessi has been compared with Cristiano Ronaldo (left) throughout much of their careers.\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Cristiano Ronaldo, who many consider his career rival.[258] Both achieved numerous individual accolades, won dozens of trophies for both club and country, and are the two leading goal scorers in history. Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[270][271] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[272] Pundits have compared the ongoing rivalry to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Prost–Senna rivalry in motorsport, and the tennis rivalries between Federer–Nadal and Borg–McEnroe.[273]\\nFans and pundits alike regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[272][274] Messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling, playmaking, passing and goalscoring, while Ronaldo has received praise for his exceptional speed and athleticism, goalscoring skills, and performance under pressure.[275][276] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87\\xa0m (6\\xa0ft 1+1⁄2\\xa0in) with a muscular build, compared to Messi\\'s smaller size – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo\\'s self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi\\'s humility.[277] Regarding individual achievements, Messi has won eight Ballons d\\'Or to Ronaldo\\'s five,[278] eight FIFA World\\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\\'s four.[279] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[280]\\nMessi\\'s head-to-head record against teams that feature Ronaldo consists of 15 wins, 9 draws, and 10 losses in competitive club matches, one win and loss each in international friendlies, and one win in a club friendly. The first competitive matchup between the two occurred in 2008, when Ronaldo\\'s Manchester United were drawn to play Messi\\'s Barcelona in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, where Ronaldo and Manchester United would eventually advance 1–0 on aggregate, and go on to win the final.[281] The two players and their teams would meet again in the next year\\'s Champions League, this time in the final, with Messi and Barcelona emerging as the victors after a 2–0 result.[282] After this, Ronaldo would transfer to Real Madrid, the main rivals of Barcelona, and from 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world\\'s most viewed annual sports events.[283][280] Ronaldo\\'s would then transfer to Juventus in the summer of 2018; their final matchup in a competitive match would occur during a 2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage match, where Ronaldo\\'s two goals from the penalty spot helped Juventus to a 3–0 victory against Messi\\'s Barcelona.[284] After Ronaldo left Real Madrid for Juventus, Messi stated: \"I miss Cristiano. Although it was a bit difficult to see him win trophies, he gave La Liga prestige.\"[285]\\nFollowing Messi leading Argentina to victory in the 2022 World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi settled the debate between the two players.[286][287] Ronaldo himself declared a year later that his rivalry with Messi was over and \"gone\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \"sharing the stage\".[288]\\nComparisons with Diego Maradona\\nMain article: New Maradona\\n\\n\"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.\"\\n\\n– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006.[289]\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who was also considered the best player of his generation and one of greatest in the history of the sport.[290][291] This was due to their short statures, their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed playmakers, and the fact that they both came from Argentina.[292] Initially, Messi was merely one of many young Argentine players to receive the \"New Maradona\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the best player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[29][293] Even when Messi was 18 years old, Maradona called him the best player in the world and hailed him as his successor.[289] Messi and Maradona would work together as player and manager for Argentina\\'s national side from 2008 through the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the latter thoroughly impressed with the former\\'s skills.[294] It was during this period that Messi was given Argentina\\'s number 10 shirt that Maradona famously wore. Maradona gave Messi his blessing, telling him: \"the No 10 is yours. There\\'s nobody better than you to wear it.\"[193]\\n\\nDue to their similar size and style of play, Messi was constantly compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona by pundits and his countrymen.\\nDuring the early and middle parts of his career, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona in Argentine society. Part of this had to do with Messi\\'s lack of tournament success and perceived uneven output with the national team during this period – Maradona had famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 FIFA World Cup with a dominant overall performance, which set expectations for Messi to do the same.[267][290][295] Also unlike Maradona, Messi never played in the Argentine Primera División, therefore depriving his countrymen a chance to watch him develop and prove himself, and through no fault of his own would do this overseas in La Liga instead.[23][295] Argentines also identified more with the fiery, extroverted and controversial Maradona who came from the slums, character traits that they felt aligned with their national values, as opposed to the reserved, introverted and unassuming Messi who had a comparable unremarkable upbringing in Rosario.[269][295][296] Several pundits, footballing figures, and Maradona himself would point to this temperament to question Messi\\'s leadership capabilities for the national team.[267][297][298] Furthermore, Messi\\'s lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt, early tendency not to sing the national anthem, and disinclination to emotional displays have in the past led to the false perception that he felt more Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[197][299] However, despite having lived in Barcelona since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally, saying: \"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\"[300]\\n\\nA mural featuring both Maradona and Messi following Argentina\\'s World Cup win in 2022.\\nFootball journalist Tim Vickery stated the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \"more one of the group, more Argentine\".[299] Other pundits noted that Messi had grown more assertive as a leader during the 2019 Copa América by becoming more vocal with his teammates both on and off the pitch, finally singing the national anthem with the team before matches, and speaking with journalists at length after matches, the latter of which he rarely did for Barcelona.[301] Following the 2022 World Cup win for Messi and Argentina, Vickery felt that Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[299] Former footballer turned journalist Jorge Valdano said he saw a \"Maradonian\" edge to Messi\\'s performances during the tournament, while compatriot Osvaldo Ardiles mentioned that Messi\\'s provoking actions against the Netherlands side during the quarter-final were \"more of a Maradona reaction,\" further endearing Messi to his countrymen.[302][303] Messi himself later remarked that the World Cup victory \"won over all the people of Argentina. Today 95% or 100% of Argentines love me and that\\'s a beautiful feeling.\"[304]\\nIn popular culture\\nPopularity\\n\\nMessi\\'s success on the pitch earned him several lucrative endorsement deals along with widespread recognition and popularity.\\nMessi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world\\'s most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023.[305][306][307] According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[308][309] World Press Photo selected \"The Final Game\", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina\\'s final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[310] On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".[311]\\nHis fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi\\'s Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Ronaldo.[312][313] He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Ronaldo.[314] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 75 million likes.[315]\\nOn 20 March 2023, during a return to Buenos Aires following his World Cup victory, Messi was mobbed by hundreds of adoring fans when he and his family were out to dinner. When news spread where Messi and his family were, the restaurant was soon surrounded by locals hoping to get a glimpse of their World Cup-winning captain. Police assistance would be needed to get Messi back to his car in the early hours of the morning.[316] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[317] During the festival, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[318] In December 2023, a set of shirts Messi had worn during the 2022 World Cup was sold at auction for $7.8 million.[319]\\nDuring an exhibition match on 4 February 2024 in which Inter Miami faced off against the Hong Kong League players at Hong Kong Stadium, Messi would remain on the bench the entire game, causing massive backlash in Hong Kong and China as a result.[320] A Messi commercial was taken off air in those regions,[321] while others remained despite pressure from Chinese social-media users.[322][323][324] Furthermore, the Chinese Football Association temporarily halted its partnership with the Argentine Football Association over the incident on 8 February.[325]\\nWealth and sponsorships\\nMessi was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40\\xa0million benchmark, with earnings of €41\\xa0million in 2013, and the €50–€60\\xa0million points, with income of €65\\xa0million in 2014.[326][327] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world\\'s highest-paid athletes, after Cristiano Ronaldo, with income of $81\\xa0million from salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[328] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[329] Forbes ranked him the world\\'s highest-paid athlete in 2019.[330] From 2008, he was Barcelona\\'s highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8\\xa0million to €13\\xa0million over the next five years.[331][332][102] Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60\\xa0million as a signing on bonus.[333] His buyout clause was set at $835\\xa0million (€700\\xa0million).[333] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1\\xa0billion in earnings during their careers.[334]\\n\\nMessi\\'s Argentina jersey, supplied by Adidas, was sold out worldwide during the 2022 World Cup.[335]\\nIn addition to salary and bonuses, much of Messi\\'s income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world\\'s most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[336] His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona\\'s leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival\\'s claim to his image rights in court.[337] Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[280] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[338][339] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[340] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi\\'s name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[341] At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out Messi\\'s No. 10 Argentina jersey worldwide.[335]\\n\\nAfter blessing himself, Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother.[342] His goal celebration features in the FIFA video game series.\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi\\'s brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[343][344] From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[343][345] Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[346][347][348][349] Messi was the face of Konami\\'s video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[350][351]\\nIn 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube\\'s founding.[352][353] In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\"[354]\\nIn May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia\\'s tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia\\'s poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[355][356]\\nPhilanthropy\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[357][358] Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country\\'s children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[359] To celebrate his son\\'s first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[360]\\n\\nMessi (pictured in 2007) has worked with UNICEF since 2004 and has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2010.\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[361] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[362] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[362][363] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \"Messi and Friends\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[364][365] A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25\\xa0kg (55\\xa0lb) and valued at $5.3\\xa0million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[366]\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell\\'s Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[362] At Newell\\'s Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club\\'s stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell\\'s, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[23] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[367] Messi made a donation worth €1\\xa0million ($1.1\\xa0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[368] This was split between Clinic Barcelona in Barcelona and his native Argentina.[369] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he would be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[370]\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team\\'s security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[371][372] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d\\'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé\\'s record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[373]\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa América, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America\\'s football players.[374] A deal brokered by Uruguay\\'s president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that \"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\".[374]\\nIn January 2025, Messi was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States, by President Joe Biden for his contributions in supporting healthcare and education programs for children around the world.[375] He would be unable to attend the ceremony due to scheduling conflicts, but sent a letter expressing his appreciation for the honor and his hopes of meeting President Biden at a later date.[376]\\nPublic art\\n\\nOne of many street art displays depicting Messi.\\nStreet art and public murals depicting Messi are regularly painted around the world.[377][378] One prominent artwork that went viral is the Sistine Chapel of Football, a parody of Leonardo Da Vinci\\'s The Creation of Adam that features both Messi and Diego Maradona, along with several other prominent Argentine footballers. The work is exhibited at the Sportivo Pereyra club from Barracas in Buenos Aires.[379]\\nSeveral public sculptures with Messi\\'s likeness have been erected. Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012.[380] After the announcement of his first retirement from the international team in June 2016, a bronze statue of Messi was erected in Buenos Aires days later in an attempt to convince him to return.[381] A life-sized statue of Messi holding the World Cup trophy was unveiled outside the CONMEBOL headquarters in Luque, Paraguay in March 2023, a few months after Argentina\\'s World Cup win. The statue would stand alongside those of Pelé and Maradona.[382]\\nMedia\\nMessi, a documentary by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival in August 2014.[383] Messi\\'s World Cup: The Rise of a Legend, a biographical docuseries focusing on Messi\\'s career, his highs and lows with the Argentina national football team, and fairytale ending of with the 2022 FIFA World Cup, aired on Apple TV+ on 21 February 2024.[384]\\nBusiness ventures\\nOn 4 June 2024, Messi announced the release of Más+, an American brand of sports and energy drinks.[385] Messi created the drink because he couldn\\'t find a flavorful and healthy hydration option that suited his needs.[386] The drink was teased to debut in Miami, Florida, on 13 June 2024. It was released in Publix and Walmart stores and made available for delivery on Gopuff in South Florida the following day.[385] Más+ is affiliated with White Claw Hard Seltzer founder Mark Anthony.[387]\\nLater that year, on 19 September 2024, Messi announced that he would be launching a production company called 525 Rosario, named after his hometown. Headquartered in Miami and Los Angeles, the company was created to produce film, sporting events and branded commercials for athletes worldwide. It would be a joint venture with Smuggler Entertainment, who co-produced Messi\\'s World Cup: The Rise of a Legend earlier in 2024.[388]\\nPersonal life\\nFamily and relationships\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, who he eventually married on 30 June 2017 in their hometown of Rosario.[389][390] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[391] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[392]\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner\\'s first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina\\'s 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[393] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[394] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[395] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[396] Messi and his family are Catholic.[397]\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[398]\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family\\'s old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of \\'87\" at Newell\\'s Old Boys. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell\\'s embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[23][362][399] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell\\'s.[400] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[401]\\nTax fraud\\nMessi\\'s financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1\\xa0million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1\\xa0million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7\\xa0million and €1.4\\xa0million in fines.[402] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\"[403]\\nCareer statistics\\nClub\\nAs of match played 13 March

According to FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, Messi by Guillem Balagué, his surname is the single \"Messi\", in accordance with Argentine customs.[2][3] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double \"Messi Cuccittini\".[4] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi\\'s own management company stated: \"The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders.\"[5]\\n^ a b c Messi received the FIFA World Player of the Year award, now known as the The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player, in 2009. This totals up to four of these awards.\\n\\n^ a b According to FC Barcelona,[6] FIFA,[7] Major League Soccer,[8] the Royal Spanish Football Federation,[9] and multiple media outlets,[10][11][12] Messi also won the 2005 Supercopa de España, bringing his Barcelona trophy total to 35—and his career total to 46.[13] However, this particular trophy is not credited here since Messi was out of the squad and did not feature in any of the two games against Real Betis.[14][15]\\n\\n\\n^ a b Does not include an unofficial friendly match played on 24 May 2008 in Barcelona between Argentina U23 and the Catalonia national football team,[428][429] as Catalonia is not affiliated with either FIFA or UEFA as a national member association and is therefore not allowed to participate in official competitions[430]\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n^ a b c \"FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ – Squad List: Argentina (ARG)\" (PDF).

Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics.[1][5] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called \"the world\\'s most famous equation\".[6] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.[7]\\nBorn in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.[note 1] In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews,[8] he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940.[9] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research.\\nIn 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers.[10] In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole.[11][12] In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.[13]\\nIn the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose-Einstein statistics. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory\\'s introduction of fundamental randomness into science\\'s picture of the world, objecting that God does not play dice.[14] Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics.\\nLife and career\\nChildhood, youth and education\\nSee also: Einstein family\\nEinstein in 1882, age\\xa03\\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm,[15] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich\\'s borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein\\'s father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.[15] He often related a formative event from his youth, when he was sick in bed and his father brought him a compass. This sparked his lifelong fascination with electromagnetism. He realized that \"Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.\"[16]\\nAlbert attended St. Peter\\'s Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five. When he was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.[17]\\nEinstein\\'s parents, Hermann and Pauline\\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob\\'s company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative.[18] The failure of their bid forced them to sell their Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. The Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani.[19] Einstein, then fifteen, stayed behind in Munich in order to finish his schooling. His father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasium\\'s regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. He later wrote that the school\\'s policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpold\\'s authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his family in Pavia.[20] While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field\".[21][22]\\nEinstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior. He began teaching himself algebra, calculus and Euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday.[23][24] A family tutor, Max Talmud, said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old Einstein a geometry textbook, the boy had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics\\xa0... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.[25] Einstein recorded that he had \"mastered integral and differential calculus\" while still just fourteen.[26] His love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve, he was already confident that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\".[25]\\nEinstein in 1893, age\\xa014\\nAt thirteen, when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy,[27] Talmud introduced Einstein to Kant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher; according to Talmud, At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant\\'s works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.[25]\\nIn 1895, at the age of sixteen, Einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test,[28] but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics.[29] On the advice of the polytechnic\\'s principal, he completed his secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school (a gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896.[30] While lodging in Aarau with the family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler\\'s daughter, Marie. (His sister, Maja, later married Winteler\\'s son Paul.[31])\\nEinstein\\'s Matura certificate from canton Aargau, 1896[note 2]\\nIn January 1896, with his father\\'s approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship of the German Kingdom of Württemberg in order to avoid conscription into military service.[32] The Matura (graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary schooling), awarded to him in September 1896, acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum, allotting him a top grade of 6 for history, physics, algebra, geometry, and descriptive geometry.[33] At seventeen, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, a year older than him, took up a teaching post in Olsberg, Switzerland.[31]\\nThe five other polytechnic school freshmen following the same course as Einstein included just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Marić. Over the next few years, the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the polytechnic school\\'s lectures did not cover. In his letters to Marić, Einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude. Eventually the two students became not only friends but also lovers.[34]\\nHistorians of physics are divided on the question of the extent to which Marić contributed to the insights of Einstein\\'s annus mirabilis publications. There is at least some evidence that he was influenced by her scientific ideas,[34][35][36] but there are scholars who doubt whether her impact on his thought was of any great significance at all.[37][38][39][40]\\nMarriages, relationships and children\\nAlbert Einstein and Mileva Marić Einstein, 1912\\nCorrespondence between Einstein and Marić, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Marić was visiting her parents in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a daughter, Lieserl. When Marić returned to Switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain. A letter of Einstein\\'s that he wrote in September 1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.[41][42]\\nEinstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zurich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Eduard\\'s arrival, he described his love for his wife as \"misguided\" and mourned the \"missed life\" that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.\"[43]\\nAlbert and Elsa Einstein arriving in New York, 1921\\nIn 1912, Einstein entered into a relationship with Elsa Löwenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother\\'s side and his second cousin on his father\\'s.[44][45][46] When Marić learned of his infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with him in April 1914, she returned to Zurich, taking Hans Albert and Eduard with her.[34] Einstein and Marić were granted a divorce on 14 February 1919 on the grounds of having lived apart for five years.[47][48] As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize, he would give the money that he received to Marić; he won the prize two years later.[49]\\nEinstein married Löwenthal in 1919.[50][51] In 1923, he began a relationship with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of his close friend Hans Mühsam.[52][53][54][55] Löwenthal nevertheless remained loyal to him, accompanying him when he emigrated to the United States in 1933. In 1935, she was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems. She died in December 1936.[56]\\nAlbert and Elsa Einstein, 1930\\nA volume of Einstein\\'s letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006[57] added some other women with whom he was romantically involved. They included Margarete Lebach (a married Austrian),[58] Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he accepted gifts while married to Löwenthal.[59][60] After being widowed, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova, thought by some to be a Russian spy; her husband, the Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov, created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.[61][62]\\nFollowing an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty, Einstein\\'s son Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia.[63] He spent the remainder of his life either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum. After her death, he was committed permanently to Burghölzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich.[64]\\n1902–1909: Assistant at the Swiss Patent Office\\nEinstein at the Swiss patent office, 1904\\nEinstein graduated from the federal polytechnic school in 1900, duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics.[65] His successful acquisition of Swiss citizenship in February 1901[66] was not followed by the usual sequel of conscription; the Swiss authorities deemed him medically unfit for military service. He found that Swiss schools too appeared to have no use for him, failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two years that he spent applying for one. Eventually it was with the help of Marcel Grossmann\\'s father that he secured a post in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office,[67][68] as an assistant examiner – level III.[69][70]\\nPatent applications that landed on Einstein\\'s desk for his evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter.[70] His employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent in 1903, although they did not think that he should be promoted until he had \"fully mastered machine technology\".[71] It is conceivable that his labors at the patent office had a bearing on his development of his special theory of relativity. He arrived at his revolutionary ideas about space, time and light through thought experiments about the transmission of signals and the synchronization of clocks, matters which also figured in some of the inventions submitted to him for assessment.[10]\\nIn 1902, Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern formed a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy. Their choice of a name for their club, the Olympia Academy, was an ironic comment upon its far from Olympian status. Sometimes they were joined by Marić, who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listening.[72] The thinkers whose works they reflected upon included Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach and David Hume, all of whom significantly influenced Einstein\\'s own subsequent ideas and beliefs.[73]\\n1900–1905: First scientific papers\\nEinstein\\'s 1905 dissertation, Eine neue Be\\xadstimm\\xadung der Mol\\xade\\xadkül\\xaddi\\xadmen\\xadsi\\xadone (\"A new deter\\xadmi\\xadna\\xadtion of mo\\xadlec\\xadu\\xadlar di\\xadmen\\xadsions\")\\nEinstein\\'s first paper, \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\" (\"Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity\"), in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that he afterwards disavowed as worthless, was published in the journal Annalen der Physik in 1901.[74][75] His 24-page doctoral dissertation also addressed a topic in molecular physics. Titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\") and dedicated to his friend Marcel Grossman, it was completed on 30 April 1905[76] and approved by Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of Zurich three months later. (Einstein was formally awarded his PhD on 15 January 1906.)[76][77][78] Four other pieces of work that Einstein completed in 1905—his famous papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy—have led to the year being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics akin to 1666 (the year in which Isaac Newton experienced his greatest epiphanies). The publications deeply impressed Einstein\\'s contemporaries.[79]\\n1908–1933: Academic career in Europe\\nEinstein\\'s sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908, when he secured a junior teaching position at the University of Bern. In 1909, a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the University of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zurich\\'s luring him away from Bern with a newly created associate professorship.[80] Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when he accepted a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required him to become an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was not completed.[citation needed] His time in Prague saw him producing eleven research papers.[81]\\nEinstein with colleagues at the ETH in Zurich, 1913\\nIn July 1912, he returned to his alma mater, the ETH Zurich, to take up a chair in theoretical physics. His teaching activities there centered on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics, and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat, continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation. In his work on the latter topic, he was assisted by his friend Marcel Grossmann, whose knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than his own.[82]\\nIn the spring of 1913, two German visitors, Max Planck and Walther Nernst, called upon Einstein in Zurich in the hope of persuading him to relocate to Berlin.[83] They offered him membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the directorship of the planned Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him.[45] Their invitation was all the more appealing to him because Berlin happened to be the home of his latest girlfriend, Elsa Löwenthal.[83] He duly joined the Academy on 24 July 1913,[84] and moved into an apartment in the Berlin district of Dahlem on 1 April 1914.[45] He was installed in his Humboldt University position shortly thereafter.[84]\\nEinstein with other physicists and chemists in Berlin, 1920\\nThe outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 marked the beginning of Einstein\\'s gradual estrangement from the nation of his birth. When the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German thinkers that justified Germany\\'s belligerence—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to distance himself from it and sign the alternative, eirenic \"Manifesto to the Europeans\" instead.[85][86] However, this expression of his doubts about German policy did not prevent him from being elected to a two-year term as president of the German Physical Society in 1916.[87] When the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics opened its doors the following year—its foundation delayed because of the war—Einstein was appointed its first director, just as Planck and Nernst had promised.[88]\\nEinstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1920,[89] and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1921. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".[7] At this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity skeptically, and the Nobel citation displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity that it acknowledged: it did not assent to Einstein\\'s notion of the particulate nature of light, which only won over the entire scientific community when S. N. Bose derived the Planck spectrum in 1924. That same year, Einstein was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[90] Britain\\'s closest equivalent of the Nobel award, the Royal Society\\'s Copley Medal, was not hung around Einstein\\'s neck until 1925.[1] He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1930.[91]\\nEinstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. His accomplishments in Berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity, proving the Einstein–de Haas effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and the development of Bose–Einstein statistics.[45]\\n1919: Putting general relativity to the test\\nThe New York Times reported confirmation of the bending of light by gravitation after observations (made in Príncipe and Sobral) of the 29 May 1919 eclipse were presented to a joint meeting in London of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society on 6 November 1919.[92]\\nIn 1907, Einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle, which asserts that an observer in a box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists. In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun\\'s photosphere (that is, the Sun\\'s apparent surface). He reworked his calculation in 1913, having now found a way to model gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional spacetime. By the fall of 1915, his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete, and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (a slow drift in the point in Mercury\\'s elliptical orbit at which it approaches the Sun most closely).[45][93] A total eclipse of the Sun that took place on 29 May 1919 provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test, and observations performed by Sir Arthur Eddington yielded results that were consistent with his calculations. Eddington\\'s work was reported at length in newspapers around the world. On 7 November 1919, for example, the leading British newspaper, The Times, printed a banner headline that read: Revolution in Science\\xa0– New Theory of the Universe\\xa0– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.[94]\\n1921–1923: Coming to terms with fame\\nEinstein\\'s official portrait after receiving the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics\\nWith Eddington\\'s eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well, Einstein became perhaps the world\\'s first celebrity scientist, a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists\\' understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century.[95]\\nEinstein began his new life as an intellectual icon in America, where he arrived on 2 April 1921. He was welcomed to New York City by Mayor John Francis Hylan, and then spent three weeks giving lectures and attending receptions.[96] He spoke several times at Columbia University and Princeton, and in Washington, he visited the White House with representatives of the National Academy of Sciences. He returned to Europe via London, where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman Viscount Haldane. He used his time in the British capital to meet several people prominent in British scientific, political or intellectual life, and to deliver a lecture at King\\'s College.[97][98] In July 1921, he published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.\", in which he sought to sketch the American character, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America (1835).[99] He wrote of his transatlantic hosts in highly approving terms: What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.[100]\\nIn 1922, Einstein\\'s travels were to the old world rather than the new. He devoted six months to a tour of Asia that saw him speaking in Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon). After his first public lecture in Tokyo, he met Emperor Yoshihito and his wife at the Imperial Palace, with thousands of spectators thronging the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of him. (In a letter to his sons, he wrote that Japanese people seemed to him to be generally modest, intelligent and considerate, and to have a true appreciation of art.[101] But his picture of them in his diary was less flattering: [the] intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones – natural disposition? His journal also contains views of China and India which were uncomplimentary. Of Chinese people, he wrote that even the children are spiritless and look obtuse... It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.[102][103]) He was greeted with even greater enthusiasm on the last leg of his tour, in which he spent twelve days in Mandatory Palestine, newly entrusted to British rule by the League of Nations in the aftermath of the First World War. Sir Herbert Samuel, the British High Commissioner, welcomed him with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state, including a cannon salute. One reception held in his honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak: he told them that he was happy that Jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.[101]\\nEinstein\\'s decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in 1922 meant that he was unable to go to Stockholm in the December of that year to participate in the Nobel prize ceremony. His place at the traditional Nobel banquet was taken by a German diplomat, who gave a speech praising him not only as a physicist but also as a campaigner for peace.[104] A two-week visit to Spain that he undertook in 1923 saw him collecting another award, a membership of the Spanish Academy of Sciences signified by a diploma handed to him by King Alfonso XIII. (His Spanish trip also gave him a chance to meet a fellow Nobel laureate, the neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal.)[105]\\n1922–1932: Serving the League of Nations\\nEinstein at a session of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (League of Nations) of which he was a member from 1922 to 1932\\nFrom 1922 until 1932, with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924, Einstein was a member of the Geneva-based International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, a group set up by the League to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries.[106][107] He was appointed as a German delegate rather than as a representative of Switzerland because of the machinations of two Catholic activists, Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta. By persuading Secretary General Eric Drummond to deny Einstein the place on the committee reserved for a Swiss thinker, they created an opening for Gonzague de Reynold, who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine.[108] Einstein\\'s former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.[109]\\n1925: Touring South America\\nIn March and April 1925, Einstein and his wife visited South America, where they spent about a week in Brazil, a week in Uruguay and a month in Argentina.[110] Their tour was suggested by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935)[111] with the support of several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones. and was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution.[112]\\n1930–1931: Touring the US\\nEinstein in Pasadena, California, 1931\\nIn December 1930, Einstein began another significant sojourn in the United States, drawn back to the US by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the US in 1921, and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him. But he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested.[113]\\nAfter arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"the ruling monarch of the mind\".[114] Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York\\'s Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.[114] Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.[114]\\nEinstein with Charlie Chaplin at the Hollywood premiere of Chaplin\\'s City Lights, January 1931\\nEinstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was awkward, as Millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism, where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist.[115] During an address to Caltech\\'s students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.[116]\\nThis aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein\\'s outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament\", from which came his \"extraordinary intellectual energy\".[117]\\nChaplin\\'s film City Lights was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein\\'s biographer, described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity.[116] Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis.[118] Einstein and Chaplin were cheered at the premiere of the film. Chaplin said to Einstein, \"They cheer me because they understand me, and they cheer you because no one understands you.\"[116]\\n1933: Emigration to the US\\nCartoon of Einstein after shedding his \"pacifism\" wings (Charles R. Macauley, c.\\u20091933)\\nIn February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany\\'s new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.[119][120]\\nWhile at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided his family\\'s apartment in Berlin.[121] He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag had passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler\\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein\\'s personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.[122] The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.[123]\\nRefugee status\\nLanding card for Einstein\\'s 26 May 1933 arrival in Dover, England from Ostend, Belgium,[124] enroute to Oxford[125]\\nIn April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.[122] Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues, thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.[126]\\nA month later, Einstein\\'s works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\" One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.[122][127] In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, ...\\xa0I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.[122] After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment, and more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence.[128]\\nEinstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. Aided by the Academic Assistance Council, founded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi persecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.[129] He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years.[124] Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a secluded wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.[130][131]\\nWinston Churchill and Einstein at Chartwell House, 31 May 1933\\nLocker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George.[132] Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend physicist Frederick Lindemann to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.[133] Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put the Allies\\' technology ahead of theirs.[133]\\nEinstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey\\'s Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom he wrote in September 1933, requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein\\'s letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\".[134]\\nLocker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.[135] In one of his speeches he denounced Germany\\'s treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.[136] In his speech he described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.[note 3][137] Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.[135]\\nResident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study\\nPortrait of Einstein taken in 1935 at Princeton\\nOn 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout.[129] Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study,[135][138] noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.[139] At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.[139]\\nEinstein was still undecided about his future. He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933[125] and was offered a five-year research fellowship (called a \"studentship\" at Christ Church),[140][141] but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.[135][142]\\nEinstein\\'s affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.[143] He was one of the four first selected (along with John von Neumann, Kurt Gödel and Hermann Weyl[144]) at the new Institute. He soon developed a close friendship with Gödel; the two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully. He lived in Princeton at his home from 1935 onwards. The Albert Einstein House was made a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\\nWorld War II and the Manhattan Project\\nSee also: Einstein–Szilárd letter\\nFacsimile of the Einstein–Szilard letter\\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group\\'s warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.[145][146] To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.[147] He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\\nThe letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II.[148] In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian royal family[149] and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House\\'s Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein\\'s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.\\nFor Einstein, war was a disease\\xa0... [and] he called for resistance to war. By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.[150] In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them\\xa0...[151] In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.[152] In 1960 Einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS),[153] an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science, particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons.\\nUS citizenship\\nEinstein accepting a US citizenship certificate from judge Phillip Forman in 1940\\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe. He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\" without social barriers. As a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education.[154]\\nEinstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism America\\'s \"worst disease\",[127][155] seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next.[156] As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial as an alleged foreign agent in 1951.[157] When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.[158]\\nIn 1946, Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, I do not intend to be quiet about it.[159] A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.[158] Einstein has said, Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination.[155] Isaacson writes that \"When Marian Anderson, the black contralto, came to Princeton for a concert in 1937, the Nassau Inn refused her a room. So Einstein invited her to stay at his house on Main Street, in what was a deeply personal as well as symbolic gesture ... Whenever she returned to Princeton, she stayed with Einstein, her last visit coming just two months before he died.\"[160]\\nPersonal views\\nPolitical views\\nMain article: Political views of Albert Einstein\\nAlbert Einstein and Elsa Einstein arriving in New York in 1921. Accompanying them are Zionist leaders Chaim Weizmann (future president of Israel), Weizmann\\'s wife Vera Weizmann, Menahem Ussishkin, and Ben-Zion Mossinson.\\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party.[161][162] Later in his life, Einstein\\'s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\".[163][164] His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \"well-regulated system of government\" and called their rule a \"regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\". He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:\\nIn Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind\\'s conscience.[165]\\nEinstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.[135] He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.[166] He wrote I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself.[167] The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932; by the time of his death, it was 1,427 pages long.[168]\\nEinstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded. He described Gandhi as a role model for the generations to come.[169] The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931, when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram to meet his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi\\'s disciple and special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader\\'s home in 1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through Wilfrid Israel.[170]\\nRelationship with Zionism\\nMain article: Political views of Albert Einstein §\\xa0Zionism\\nEinstein was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,[171] which opened in 1925.[172] Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university.[173] He made suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country\\'s development.[174] He also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic.[175]\\nEinstein was not a nationalist and opposed the creation of an independent Jewish state.[176] He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine. The state of Israel was established without his help in 1948; Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the Zionist movement.[177] Upon the death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach.[178][179] The offer was presented by Israel\\'s ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons. Einstein wrote that he was \"deeply moved\", but \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it.[180]\\nReligious and philosophical views\\nMain article: Religious and philosophical views of Albert Einstein\\nDuration: 1 minute and 31 seconds.\\n1:31\\nOpening of Einstein\\'s speech (11 April 1943) for the United Jewish Appeal (recording by Radio Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina)\\nLadies (coughs) and gentlemen, our age is proud of the progress it has made in man\\'s intellectual development. The search and striving for truth and knowledge is one of the highest of man\\'s qualities\\xa0...\\nPer Lee Smolin, I believe what allowed Einstein to achieve so much was primarily a moral quality. He simply cared far more than most of his colleagues that the laws of physics have to explain everything in nature coherently and consistently.[181] Einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews.[182] He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza\\'s philosophy.[183] He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve.[184] He clarified, however, that I am not an atheist,[185] preferring to call himself an agnostic,[186][187] or a deeply religious nonbeliever.[184] He wrote that A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort.[188]\\nEinstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York,[189] and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, Without \\'ethical culture\\' there is no salvation for humanity.[190]\\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:\\nThe word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything \\'chosen\\' about them.[191]\\nEinstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth, vice-president of the German Vegetarian Federation (Deutsche Vegetarier-Bund), he wrote:\\nAlthough I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.[192]\\nHe became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life. In March 1954 he wrote in a letter: So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.[193]\\nLove of music\\nEinstein playing the violin, 1927\\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote:\\nIf I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music\\xa0... I get most joy in life out of music.[194][195]\\nHis mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.[196]\\nWhen he turned 13, he discovered Mozart\\'s violin sonatas, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart\\'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.[196] At the age of 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of \\'great insight\\'. What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.[196]\\nMusic took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein\\'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zurich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalog of Mozart\\'s work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.[197][198] Mozart was a special favorite; he said that \"Mozart\\'s music is so pure it seems to have been ever-present in the universe.\" He prefered Bach to Beethoven: \"Give me Bach, rather, and then more Bach.\"[199]\\nIn 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart\\'s works with members of the Zoellner Quartet.[200][201] Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was impressed by Einstein\\'s level of coordination and intonation.[196]\\nDeath\\nOn 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[202] He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel\\'s seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.[203]\\nEinstein refused surgery, saying, I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.[204] He died in the Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.[205]\\nDuring the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein\\'s brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent.[206] Einstein\\'s remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey,[207] and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.[208][209]\\nIn a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness\\xa0... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.[210]\\nEinstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.[211]\\nScientific career\\nThroughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.[15][212] He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones.[11][212] On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein\\'s papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents.[213][214] In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.[215][216]\\nStatistical mechanics\\nThermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics\\nMain articles: Statistical mechanics, thermal fluctuations, and statistical physics\\nEinstein\\'s first paper[74][217] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.[217]\\nTheory of critical opalescence\\nMain article: Critical opalescence\\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.[218] Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\\n1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers\\nThe Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E\\xa0=\\xa0mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The four papers are:\\nTitle (translated)  Area of focus   Received    Published   Significance\\n\"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\"[219]   Photoelectric effect    18 March    9 June  Resolved an unsolved puzzle by suggesting that energy is exchanged only in discrete amounts (quanta).[220] This idea was pivotal to the early development of quantum theory.[221]\\n\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat\"[222]   Brownian motion 11 May  18 July Explained empirical evidence for the atomic theory, supporting the application of statistical physics.\\n\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\"[223]  Special relativity  30 June 26\\xa0September    Reconciled Maxwell\\'s equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing changes to mechanics, resulting from analysis based on empirical evidence that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer.[224][specify] Discredited the concept of a \"luminiferous ether\".[225]\\n\"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?\"[226]   Matter–energy equivalence   27\\xa0September    21 November Equivalence of matter and energy, E\\xa0=\\xa0mc2, the existence of \"rest energy\", and the basis of nuclear energy.\\nSpecial relativity\\nMain article: History of special relativity\\nEinstein\\'s \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\"[223] (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell\\'s equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.[227] Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein\\'s special theory of relativity.\\nThis paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.[note 4]\\nIn his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E\\xa0=\\xa0mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations.[228] Einstein\\'s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.[note 5][229]\\nEinstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski\\'s formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.[230]\\nGeneral relativity\\nGeneral relativity and the equivalence principle\\nMain article: History of general relativity\\nSee also: Theory of relativity and Einstein field equations\\nEddington\\'s photo of a solar eclipse\\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.[231]\\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.[232] Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing.[233][234]\\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.[235]\\nGravitational waves\\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves,[236][237] ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.[238] The explanation for the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.[238][239] Einstein\\'s prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves,[240] detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.[238][241][242][243][244]\\nHole argument and Entwurf theory\\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.[245]\\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\\'draft\\') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken[246] and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\\nPhysical cosmology\\nMain article: Physical cosmology\\nRobert A. Millikan, Georges Lemaître and Einstein at the California Institute of Technology in January 1933\\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.[247] He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, into the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein\\'s understanding of Mach\\'s principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein\\'s static universe.[248][249]\\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the Friedmann–Einstein universe of 1931[250][251] and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932.[252][253] In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".[250][251][254]\\nIn many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\", based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from him. The astrophysicist Mario Livio has cast doubt on this claim.[255]\\nIn late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble\\'s observations of the recession of the galaxies, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe.[256][257] In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process that he associated with the cosmological constant.[258][259] As he stated in the paper, In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel\\'s [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time [...] If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\\nIt thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.[260][261] However, Einstein\\'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.[258][259][262]\\nEnergy momentum pseudotensor\\nMain article: Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor\\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether\\'s theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether\\'s prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.[263]\\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. While the use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by Erwin Schrödinger and others, Einstein\\'s approach has been echoed by physicists including Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz.[264]\\nWormholes\\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges.[265][266] His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches. Because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, Einstein and Rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles. However, it was later found that Einstein–Rosen bridges are not stable.[267]\\nEinstein–Cartan theory\\nMain article: Einstein–Cartan theory\\nEinstein at his office, University of Berlin, 1920\\nIn order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\\nEquations of motion\\nMain article: Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations\\nIn general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime. A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body\\'s attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.[268][269] The Einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The geodesic equation covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. Einstein regarded this as an \"independent fundamental assumption\" that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory. Believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves. Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. Accordingly, Einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains disputed.[270][271]\\nOld quantum theory\\nMain article: Old quantum theory\\nPhotons and energy quanta\\nThe photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.\\nIn a 1905 paper,[219] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein\\'s light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan\\'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is the Planck constant. He did not say much more, because he was not sure how the particles were related to the wave. But he did suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.[219] Light quanta were dubbed photons by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926.[272]\\nQuantized atomic vibrations\\nMain article: Einstein solid\\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.[273]\\nBose–Einstein statistics\\nMain article: Bose–Einstein statistics\\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose\\'s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose\\'s paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.[274] It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.[275] Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein\\'s sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.[215]\\nWave–particle duality\\nEinstein in 1921, by Harris & Ewing studio\\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern.[276] In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck\\'s energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\\nZero-point energy\\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.[277]\\nStimulated emission\\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.[278] This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck\\'s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.[279]\\nMatter waves\\nEinstein discovered Louis de Broglie\\'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein observed that de Broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of Bohr and Sommerfeld. This paper would inspire Schrödinger\\'s work of 1926.[280][281]\\nQuantum mechanics\\nEinstein\\'s objections to quantum mechanics\\nNewspaper headline on 4 May 1935\\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\".[282] Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.[283]\\nBohr versus Einstein\\nMain article: Bohr–Einstein debates\\nEinstein and Niels Bohr, 1925\\nThe Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science.[284][285][286] Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.\\nEinstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox\\nMain article: EPR paradox\\nEinstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics. While he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible. Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930. Einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other. The quantum-mechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction. If the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given, then the Schrödinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction. But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is. Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object. Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast. Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question. Because the true \"physical condition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it.[287][288]\\nA more famous version of this argument came in 1935, when Einstein published a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox.[289] In this thought experiment, two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled. Then, no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other particle. Likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way. They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the theory of relativity. They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that: If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity. From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured. But quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality.[290]\\nIn 1964, John Stewart Bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. This constraint would later be called a Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are \"nonlocal\", which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated.[291][292] Bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the EPR paradox is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least.[293]\\nDespite this, and although Einstein personally found the argument in the EPR paper overly complicated,[287][288] that paper became among the most influential papers published in Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.[294]\\nUnified field theory\\nMain article: Classical unified field theories\\nEncouraged by his success with general relativity, Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he described his unified field theory in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\".[295] His attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success: a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was well understood until many years after his death. Although most researchers now believe that Einstein\\'s approach to unifying physics was mistaken, his goal of a theory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire.[296]\\nOther investigations\\nMain article: Einstein\\'s unsuccessful investigations\\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.\\nCollaboration with other scientists\\nThe 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels, a gathering of the world\\'s top physicists. Einstein is in the center.\\nIn addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\\nEinstein–de Haas experiment\\nMain article: Einstein–de Haas effect\\nIn 1908, Owen Willans Richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause this body to rotate. This effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials.[297] Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of the effect.[298][299] Measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment (polarization) of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization. These measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization: that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons. The Einstein-de Haas experiment is the only experiment concived, realized and published by Albert Einstein himself.\\nA complete original version of the Einstein-de Haas experimental equipment was donated by Geertruida de Haas-Lorentz, wife of de Haas and daughter of Lorentz, to the Ampère Museum in Lyon France in 1961 where it is currently on display. It was lost among the museum\\'s holdings and was rediscovered in 2023.[300][301]\\nEinstein as an inventor\\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.[302] On 11 November 1930, U.S. patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, but the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.[note 6]\\nEinstein also invented an electromagnetic pump,[304] sound reproduction device,[305] and several other household devices.[306]\\nLegacy\\nNon-scientific\\nLeft-right: Heinrich Goldschmidt, Einstein, Ole Colbjørnsen, Jørgen Vogt, and Ilse Einstein at a picnic in Oslo in 1920.\\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986[307]). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University\\'s Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.[308]\\nIn 1979, the Albert Einstein Memorial was unveiled outside the National Academy of Sciences building in Washington, D.C. for the Einstein centenary. It was sculpted by Robert Berks. Einstein can be seen holding a paper with three of his most important equations: for the photoelectric effect, general relativity and mass-energy equivalence.[309]\\nBronze figure of Albert Einstein by Robert Berks\\nEinstein\\'s right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the right had expired,[310] that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right.[311] Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.[312]\\nMount Einstein in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named in 1955. Mount Einstein in New Zealand\\'s Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.[313]\\nIn 1999, Einstein was named Time\\'s Person of the Century.[314]\\nScientific\\nIn 1999, a survey of the top 100 physicists voted for Einstein as the \"greatest physicist ever\", while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists gave the top spot to Isaac Newton, with Einstein second.[315][316]\\nPhysicist Lev Landau ranked physicists from 0 to 5 on a logarithmic scale of productivity and genius, with Newton and Einstein belonging in a \"super league\", with Newton receiving the highest ranking of 0, followed by Einstein with 0.5, while fathers of quantum mechanics such as Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac were ranked 1, with Landau himself a 2.[317]\\nPhysicist Eugene Wigner noted that while John von Neumann had the quickest and acute mind he ever knew, the understanding of Einstein was deeper than von Neumann\\'s, stating that:[318]\\nBut Einstein\\'s understanding was deeper than even Jancsi von Neumann\\'s. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann\\'s. And that is a very remarkable statement. Einstein took an extraordinary pleasure in invention. Two of his greatest inventions are the Special and General Theories of Relativity; and for all of Jancsi\\'s brilliance, he never produced anything so original. No modern physicist has.\\nThe year 2005 was labeled the \"World Year of Physics\", and was also known as \"Einstein Year\", in recognition of Einstein\\'s \"miracle year\" in 1905.\\nIn popular culture\\nMain article: Albert Einstein in popular culture\\nThe famous image of Einstein taken by Arthur Sasse in 1951\\nEinstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities after the confirmation of his general theory of relativity in 1919.[319][320][321] Although most of the public had little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and admired. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". Eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else: Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.[322]\\nEinstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.[323] He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine\\'s Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist\\'s dream come true\".[324] His intellectual achievements and originality made Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.[325]\\nMany popular quotations are often misattributed to him.[326][327]\\nAwards and honors\\nMain article: List of awards and honors received by Albert Einstein\\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.[7]\\nEinsteinium, a synthetic chemical element, was named in his honor in 1955, a few months after his death.[328]\\nPublications\\nScientific\\nFurther information: List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein\\nEinstein, Albert (1901) [Completed 13 December 1900 and manuscript received 16 December 1900].

Wormholes have never been observed, but they are predicted to exist through mathematical models and scientific theory.\\nTheoretical physics is a branch of physics that employs mathematical models and abstractions of physical objects and systems to rationalize, explain, and predict natural phenomena. This is in contrast to experimental physics, which uses experimental tools to probe these phenomena.\\nThe advancement of science generally depends on the interplay between experimental studies and theory. In some cases, theoretical physics adheres to standards of mathematical rigour while giving little weight to experiments and observations.[a] For example, while developing special relativity, Albert Einstein was concerned with the Lorentz transformation which left Maxwell\\'s equations invariant, but was apparently uninterested in the Michelson–Morley experiment on Earth\\'s drift through a luminiferous aether.[1] Conversely, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for explaining the photoelectric effect, previously an experimental result lacking a theoretical formulation.[2]\\nOverview\\n[edit]\\nA physical theory is a model of physical events. It is judged by the extent to which its predictions agree with empirical observations. The quality of a physical theory is also judged on its ability to make new predictions which can be verified by new observations. A physical theory differs from a mathematical theorem in that while both are based on some form of axioms, judgment of mathematical applicability is not based on agreement with any experimental results.[3][4] A physical theory similarly differs from a mathematical theory, in the sense that the word \"theory\" has a different meaning in mathematical terms.[b]\\n\\nR i c \\\\= k g {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {Ric} =kg}  The equations for an Einstein manifold, used in general relativity to describe the curvature of spacetime\\n\\nA physical theory involves one or more relationships between various measurable quantities. Archimedes realized that a ship floats by displacing its mass of water, Pythagoras understood the relation between the length of a vibrating string and the musical tone it produces.[5][6] Other examples include entropy as a measure of the uncertainty regarding the positions and motions of unseen particles and the quantum mechanical idea that (action and) energy are not continuously variable.\\nTheoretical physics consists of several different approaches. In this regard, theoretical particle physics forms a good example. For instance: \"phenomenologists\" might employ (semi-) empirical formulas and heuristics to agree with experimental results, often without deep physical understanding.[c] \"Modelers\" (also called \"model-builders\") often appear much like phenomenologists, but try to model speculative theories that have certain desirable features (rather than on experimental data), or apply the techniques of mathematical modeling to physics problems.[d] Some attempt to create approximate theories, called effective theories, because fully developed theories may be regarded as unsolvable or too complicated. Other theorists may try to unify, formalise, reinterpret or generalise extant theories, or create completely new ones altogether.[e] Sometimes the vision provided by pure mathematical systems can provide clues to how a physical system might be modeled;[f] e.g., the notion, due to Riemann and others, that space itself might be curved. Theoretical problems that need computational investigation are often the concern of computational physics.\\nTheoretical advances may consist in setting aside old, incorrect paradigms (e.g., aether theory of light propagation, caloric theory of heat, burning consisting of evolving phlogiston, or astronomical bodies revolving around the Earth) or may be an alternative model that provides answers that are more accurate or that can be more widely applied. In the latter case, a correspondence principle will be required to recover the previously known result.[7][8] Sometimes though, advances may proceed along different paths. For example, an essentially correct theory may need some conceptual or factual revisions; atomic theory, first postulated millennia ago (by several thinkers in Greece and India) and the two-fluid theory of electricity[9] are two cases in this point. However, an exception to all the above is the wave–particle duality, a theory combining aspects of different, opposing models via the Bohr complementarity principle.\\n\\nRelationship between mathematics and physics\\nPhysical theories become accepted if they are able to make correct predictions and no (or few) incorrect ones. The theory should have, at least as a secondary objective, a certain economy and elegance (compare to mathematical beauty), a notion sometimes called \"Occam\\'s razor\" after the 13th-century English philosopher William of Occam (or Ockham), in which the simpler of two theories that describe the same matter just as adequately is preferred (but conceptual simplicity may mean mathematical complexity).[10] They are also more likely to be accepted if they connect a wide range of phenomena. Testing the consequences of a theory is part of the scientific method.\\nPhysical theories can be grouped into three categories: mainstream theories, proposed theories and fringe theories.\\nHistory\\n[edit]\\nFurther information: History of physics\\nTheoretical physics began at least 2,300 years ago, under the Pre-socratic philosophy, and continued by Plato and Aristotle, whose views held sway for a millennium. During the rise of medieval universities, the only acknowledged intellectual disciplines were the seven liberal arts of the Trivium like grammar, logic, and rhetoric and of the Quadrivium like arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the concept of experimental science, the counterpoint to theory, began with scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham and Francis Bacon. As the Scientific Revolution gathered pace, the concepts of matter, energy, space, time and causality slowly began to acquire the form we know today, and other sciences spun off from the rubric of natural philosophy. Thus began the modern era of theory with the Copernican paradigm shift in astronomy, soon followed by Johannes Kepler\\'s expressions for planetary orbits, which summarized the meticulous observations of Tycho Brahe; the works of these men (alongside Galileo\\'s) can perhaps be considered to constitute the Scientific Revolution.\\nThe great push toward the modern concept of explanation started with Galileo, one of the few physicists who was both a consummate theoretician and a great experimentalist. The analytic geometry and mechanics of Descartes were incorporated into the calculus and mechanics of Isaac Newton, another theoretician/experimentalist of the highest order, writing Principia Mathematica.[11] In it contained a grand synthesis of the work of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler; as well as Newton\\'s theories of mechanics and gravitation, which held sway as worldviews until the early 20th century. Simultaneously, progress was also made in optics (in particular colour theory and the ancient science of geometrical optics), courtesy of Newton, Descartes and the Dutchmen Snell and Huygens. In the 18th and 19th centuries Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Leonhard Euler and William Rowan Hamilton would extend the theory of classical mechanics considerably.[12] They picked up the interactive intertwining of mathematics and physics begun two millennia earlier by Pythagoras.\\nAmong the great conceptual achievements of the 19th and 20th centuries were the consolidation of the idea of energy (as well as its global conservation) by the inclusion of heat, electricity and magnetism, and then light. The laws of thermodynamics, and most importantly the introduction of the singular concept of entropy began to provide a macroscopic explanation for the properties of matter. Statistical mechanics (followed by statistical physics and Quantum statistical mechanics) emerged as an offshoot of thermodynamics late in the 19th century. Another important event in the 19th century was the discovery of electromagnetic theory, unifying the previously separate phenomena of electricity, magnetism and light.\\nThe pillars of modern physics, and perhaps the most revolutionary theories in the history of physics, have been relativity theory and quantum mechanics. Newtonian mechanics was subsumed under special relativity and Newton\\'s gravity was given a kinematic explanation by general relativity. Quantum mechanics led to an understanding of blackbody radiation (which indeed, was an original motivation for the theory) and of anomalies in the specific heats of solids — and finally to an understanding of the internal structures of atoms and molecules. Quantum mechanics soon gave way to the formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), begun in the late 1920s. In the aftermath of World War 2, more progress brought much renewed interest in QFT, which had since the early efforts, stagnated. The same period also saw fresh attacks on the problems of superconductivity and phase transitions, as well as the first applications of QFT in the area of theoretical condensed matter. The 1960s and 70s saw the formulation of the Standard model of particle physics using QFT and progress in condensed matter physics (theoretical foundations of superconductivity and critical phenomena, among others), in parallel to the applications of relativity to problems in astronomy and cosmology respectively.\\nAll of these achievements depended on the theoretical physics as a moving force both to suggest experiments and to consolidate results — often by ingenious application of existing mathematics, or, as in the case of Descartes and Newton (with Leibniz), by inventing new mathematics. Fourier\\'s studies of heat conduction led to a new branch of mathematics: infinite, orthogonal series.[13]\\nModern theoretical physics attempts to unify theories and explain phenomena in further attempts to understand the Universe, from the cosmological to the elementary particle scale. Where experimentation cannot be done, theoretical physics still tries to advance through the use of mathematical models.\\nMainstream theories\\n[edit]\\nMainstream theories (sometimes referred to as central theories) are the body of knowledge of both factual and scientific views and possess a usual scientific quality of the tests of repeatability, consistency with existing well-established science and experimentation. There do exist mainstream theories that are generally accepted theories based solely upon their effects explaining a wide variety of data, although the detection, explanation, and possible composition are subjects of debate.\\nExamples\\n[edit]\\n\\nBig Bang\\nChaos theory\\nClassical mechanics\\nClassical field theory\\nDynamo theory\\nField theory\\nGinzburg–Landau theory\\nKinetic theory of gases\\nClassical electromagnetism\\nPerturbation theory (quantum mechanics)\\nPhysical cosmology\\nQuantum chromodynamics\\nQuantum complexity theory\\nQuantum electrodynamics\\nQuantum field theory\\nQuantum field theory in curved spacetime\\nQuantum information theory\\nQuantum mechanics\\nQuantum thermodynamics\\nRelativistic quantum mechanics\\nScattering theory\\nStandard Model\\nStatistical physics\\nTheory of relativity\\nWave–particle duality\\n\\nProposed theories\\n[edit]\\nThe proposed theories of physics are usually relatively new theories which deal with the study of physics which include scientific approaches, means for determining the validity of models and new types of reasoning used to arrive at the theory. However, some proposed theories include theories that have been around for decades and have eluded methods of discovery and testing. Proposed theories can include fringe theories in the process of becoming established (and, sometimes, gaining wider acceptance). Proposed theories usually have not been tested. In addition to the theories like those listed below, there are also different interpretations of quantum mechanics, which may or may not be considered different theories since it is debatable whether they yield different predictions for physical experiments, even in principle. For example, AdS/CFT correspondence, Chern–Simons theory, graviton, magnetic monopole, string theory, theory of everything.\\nFringe theories\\n[edit]\\nFringe theories include any new area of scientific endeavor in the process of becoming established and some proposed theories. It can include speculative sciences. This includes physics fields and physical theories presented in accordance with known evidence, and a body of associated predictions have been made according to that theory.\\nSome fringe theories go on to become a widely accepted part of physics. Other fringe theories end up being disproven. Some fringe theories are a form of protoscience and others are a form of pseudoscience. The falsification of the original theory sometimes leads to reformulation of the theory.\\nExamples\\n[edit]\\n\\nAether (classical element)\\nLuminiferous aether\\n\\n\\nDigital physics\\nElectrogravitics\\nStochastic electrodynamics\\nTesla\\'s dynamic theory of gravity\\n\\nThought experiments vs real experiments\\n[edit]\\nMain article: Thought experiment\\n\"Thought\" experiments are situations created in one\\'s mind, asking a question akin to \"suppose you are in this situation, assuming such is true, what would follow?\". They are usually created to investigate phenomena that are not readily experienced in every-day situations. Famous examples of such thought experiments are Schrödinger\\'s cat, the EPR thought experiment, simple illustrations of time dilation, and so on. These usually lead to real experiments designed to verify that the conclusion (and therefore the assumptions) of the thought experiments are correct. The EPR thought experiment led to the Bell inequalities, which were then tested to various degrees of rigor, leading to the acceptance of the current formulation of quantum mechanics and probabilism as a working hypothesis.\\nSee also\\n[edit]\\n\\nList of theoretical physicists\\nPhilosophy of physics\\nSymmetry in quantum mechanics\\nTimeline of developments in theoretical physics\\nDouble field theory\\n\\nNotes\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ There is some debate as to whether or not theoretical physics uses mathematics to build intuition and illustrativeness to extract physical insight (especially when normal experience fails), rather than as a tool in formalizing theories. This links to the question of it using mathematics in a less formally rigorous, and more intuitive or heuristic way than, say, mathematical physics.\\n^ Sometimes the word \"theory\" can be used ambiguously in this sense, not to describe scientific theories, but research (sub)fields and programmes. Examples: relativity theory, quantum field theory, string theory.\\n^ The work of Johann Balmer and Johannes Rydberg in spectroscopy, and the semi-empirical mass formula of nuclear physics are good candidates for examples of this approach.\\n^ The Ptolemaic and Copernican models of the Solar system, the Bohr model of hydrogen atoms and nuclear shell model are good candidates for examples of this approach.\\n^ Arguably these are the most celebrated theories in physics: Newton\\'s theory of gravitation, Einstein\\'s theory of relativity and Maxwell\\'s theory of electromagnetism share some of these attributes.\\n^ This approach is often favoured by (pure) mathematicians and mathematical physicists.\\n\\nReferences\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ van Dongen, Jeroen (2009). \"On the role of the Michelson-Morley experiment: Einstein in Chicago\".
